<p>Big Tech has enjoyed years of unfettered growth, but now the U.S., EU, China and India have launched unprecedented crackdowns on some of the biggest names in the business. Lawmakers and regulators are going after anti-competitive practices and looking at privacy and security at companies such as Facebook and Apple, Google and Amazon.

<p>A buying spree of startups by big companies has triggered concerns on both sides of the Atlantic, with regulators worried about so-called killer acquisitions aimed at shutting down potential rivals before they are big enough to be a threat.</p>

<p>Reuters took readers on a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-banks-capital-regulation-focus-idTRNIKBN2IV1GO">deep dive</a> into how Wall Street analysts are scratching their heads over the extent to which an arcane new derivatives rule will affect the performance of big banks as they wrap up the fourth quarter. The rule is one of a slew of measures introduced by regulators to discourage banks from taking excessive risks in the over-the-counter derivatives market which contributed towards the 2007-2009 financial crisis. </p>

<p>Reuters broke the news that a sale of Royal Dutch Shell&#8217;s controlling interest in a Texas refinery to Mexican state oil company Pemex has been delayed until next year. Sources said a review of the deal by U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States had been expected to wrap up this month, but there have been additional delays. Shell in May disclosed an agreement to sell its 50% interest in the refinery to partner Pemex for about $596 million.</p>
